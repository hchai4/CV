  <h3>Projects</h3>
  <h4>A Spring and Hibernate based <a href="http://52.90.241.183/">online food ordering system</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and developed a full stack web server for people to order food online. Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout etc.</li>
    <li>Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.) Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.</li>
    <li>Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application. Built the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users add items to the shopping cart and place orders.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>An online stay rental application based on React and Spring Boot.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and built a single page web application using React. Bootstrap the development with mature
component library AntD. Implemented the backend services based on Spring Boot to support stay upload, delete,
search and reserve functionality.</li>
    <li>Used MySQL to store user-generated data, e.g. stay information and reservation history, and utilized Google
Cloud Storage to store media files for the uploaded stays. Created geo index by Elasticsearch to support geo-
based stay search based on user’s selected locations.</li>
    <li>Implemented token-based server side user authentication based on the Spring Security framework. Deployed the
backend service to Google App Engine for better scalability and reliability.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>React JS based Starlink Trajectory Visualization</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and developed a visualization dashboard using ReactJS and D3 to track satellites in real-time based on geo-location. Built location, altitude, and duration based selector to refine satellite search.</li>
    <li>Animated selected satellite paths on a world map using D3 to improve the user friendness. Deployed the dashboard to Amazon Web Service for demonstration.</li>
