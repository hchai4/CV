  <h4>A Spring and Hibernate based <a href="http://52.90.241.183/">online food ordering system</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and developed a full stack web server for people to order food online. Implemented Rest API via Spring MVC including registration, menu searching and ordering, checkout etc.</li>
    <li>Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants etc.) Provided both authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.</li>
    <li>Used the Spring framework core technologies to loosely decouple all the components in the application. Built the client side with ReactJS and Ant Design to allow users add items to the shopping cart and place orders.</li>
